Google Colaboratory
Google hosts the free Colaboratory service for running Python using a modified Jupyter notebook. The exact “look and feel” of Colab will not be the same as using a code editor like PyCharm (my favorite environment for working in Python) or even a “plain” Jupyter notebook, but the functionality is there, plus you don’t have to deal with maintaining the software and packages. 
Google Colab gives you direct access to Google’s supercomputers — you can do some pretty serious data on here, as the endorsement from TensorFlow suggests (that is a popular package for deep learning built by developers at Google). You can even execute on your Google Drive files entirely from the cloud.
