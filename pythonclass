Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:

Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file


When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:

Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
File Name: the actual name of the file
Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type


Note: It’s important to remember that it’s your responsibility to close the file. In most cases, upon termination of an application or script, a file will be closed eventually. However, there is no guarantee when exactly that will happen. This can lead to unwanted behavior including resource leaks. It’s also a best practice within Python (Pythonic) to make sure that your code behaves in a way that is well defined and reduces any unwanted behavior.

A CSV is a comma-separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a tabular format. CSVs look like a garden-variety spreadsheet but with a . csv extension. CSV files can be used with most any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets.
