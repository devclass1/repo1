WHAT ARE BIG DATA PLATFORMS?
Big data platforms are specially designed to handle unfathomable volumes of data that come into the system at high velocities and wide varieties. These big data platforms usually consist of varying servers, databases and business intelligence tools that allow data scientists to manipulate data to find trends and patterns.

How is big data used?
The diversity of big data makes it inherently complex, resulting in the need for systems capable of processing its various structural and semantic differences. 

Big data requires specialized NoSQL databases that can store the data in a way that doesn't require strict adherence to a particular model. This provides the flexibility needed to cohesively analyze seemingly disparate sources of information to gain a holistic view of what is happening, how to act and when to act.

When aggregating, processing and analyzing big data, it is often classified as either operational or analytical data and stored accordingly.

Operational systems serve large batches of data across multiple servers and includes such input as inventory, customer data and purchases — the day-to-day information within an organization.

Analytical systems are more sophisticated than their operational counterparts, capable of handling complex data analysis and providing businesses with decision-making insights. These systems will often be integrated into existing processes and infrastructure to maximize the collection and use of data.

Regardless of how it is classified, data is everywhere. Our phones, credit cards, software applications, vehicles, records, websites and the majority of “things” in our world are capable of transmitting vast amounts of data, and this information is incredibly valuable.

Big data is used in nearly every industry to identify patterns and trends, answer questions, gain insights into customers, and tackle complex problems. Companies and organizations use the information for a multitude of reasons like growing their businesses, understanding customer decisions, enhancing research, making forecasts and targeting key audiences for advertising.
