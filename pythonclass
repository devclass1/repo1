These attributes make up the three Vs of big data:   

Volume: The huge amounts of data being stored.
Velocity: The lightning speed at which data streams must be processed and analyzed.
Variety: The different sources and forms from which data is collected, such as numbers, text, video, images, audio and text.
These days, data is constantly generated anytime we open an app, search Google or simply travel place to place with our mobile devices. The result? Massive collections of valuable information that companies and organizations need to manage, store, visualize and analyze.

Traditional data tools aren't equipped to handle this kind of complexity and volume, which has led to a slew of specialized big data software and architecture solutions designed to manage the load.

Big data is essentially the wrangling of the three Vs to gain insights and make predictions, so it's useful to take a closer look at each attribute.

Volume 
Big data is enormous. While traditional data is measured in familiar sizes like megabytes, gigabytes and terabytes, big data is stored in petabytes and zettabytes. 

To grasp the enormity of difference in scale, consider this comparison from the Berkeley School of Information: one gigabyte is the equivalent of a seven minute video in HD, while a single zettabyte is equal to 250 billion DVDs.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. According to a report by EMC, the digital universe is doubling in size every two years and by 2020 is expected to reach 44 trillion zettabytes. 

Big data provides the architecture handling this kind of data. Without the appropriate solutions for storing and processing, it would be impossible to mine for insights. 

Velocity
From the speed at which it's created to the amount of time needed to analyze it, everything about big data is fast. Some have described it as trying to drink from a fire hose. 

Companies and organizations must have the capabilities to harness this data and generate insights from it in real-time, otherwise it's not very useful. Real-time processing allows decision makers to act quickly, giving them a leg up on the competition. 

While some forms of data can be batched processed and remain relevant over time, much of big data is streaming into organizations at a clip and requires immediate action for the best outcomes. Sensor data from health devices is a great example. The ability to instantly process health data can provide users and physicians with potentially life-saving information.

Variety
Roughly 95% of all big data is unstructured, meaning it does not fit easily into a straightforward, traditional model. Everything from emails and videos to scientific and meteorological data can constitute a big data stream, each with their own unique attributes.
