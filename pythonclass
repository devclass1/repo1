Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. Pyplot is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

Matplotlib.pyplot.legend()
A legend is an area describing the elements of the graph. In the matplotlib library, thereâ€™s a function called legend() which is used to Place a legend on the axes.



import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
x  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
#y1 = [1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1]
y2 = [12, 14, 16, 14, 12, 14, 16, 14, 12]
plt.plot(x, y1, label="Data of Y1")
plt.plot(x, y2, label="Data of Y2")
plt.plot()

plt.xlabel("x axis")
plt.ylabel("y axis")
plt.title("Line Graph Example")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
