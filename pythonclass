Constants
A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.


[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-131-245 test]$ cat constant.py
PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 980000
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-0-131-245 test]$ cat main.py 
import constant

print(constant.PI)
print(constant.GRAVITY)
