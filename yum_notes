Yellowdog Updater Modifier sums as YUM and this is a PMT (Package Management Tool) for the RedHat Package Manager. YUM has been used for quite a long time. But, now in RHEL 8, we have a modest version of “yum” called “dnf” stands for Dandified YUM. Although both the commands work fine in Redhat 8 Linux but dnf is much faster, as some of the bugs have been removed.

baseurl=
Refers to the base URL where the RPM packages are found.

The yum search command can help you with that. When you use yum search, it first gets in touch with the online repositories (which might take a minute), after which it downloads the most recent repository metadata to the local machine. Then, yum search looks in the package name and description for the string you have been looking for.
